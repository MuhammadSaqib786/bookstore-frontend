# BookStore Frontend with React

A frontend application built with React.js for the [BookStore API](https://github.com/MuhammadSaqib786/BookStore-Api-MongoDb). This application provides an intuitive user interface for managing a bookstore's inventory, allowing users to perform CRUD operations on books.

## Features

- **React.js**: Modern frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Efficiently handles API calls to the backend.
- **CRUD Operations**: Allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete books.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes for an optimal viewing experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Running instance of the [BookStore API](https://github.com/MuhammadSaqib786/BookStore-Api-MongoDb)


The application should now be running on `localhost:3000` or the next available port. Ensure the backend API is also running and accessible.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can navigate through the interface to view all books, add new books, update existing books, or delete books.
